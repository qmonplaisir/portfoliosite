# Web Development Portfolio
This site is a project that shows all of the projects I've done during my time studying at Code Kentucky. It is a responsive, static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript site. The layout is meant to feel modern. The logo was designed by me. This site serves as a way to display all lof my projects in a visually appealing way. 

### Three features included in this site are:
1. Visualize data in a user friendly way. (e.g. graph, chart, etc)
2. Use a regular expression to validate user input and either prevent the invalid input or inform the user about it (in all cases prevent invalid input from being stored or saved)
3.Create a form and store the submitted values using an external API (e.g. a contact form, survey, etc)
