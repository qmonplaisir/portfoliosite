            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>Hello there! My name is Quinn Monplaisir and I am a graphic designer and web developer with a fun, loving, and caring personality with great work ethic. I have an amazing gift of learning new things and mastering them. I consider myself like the character “Mike Ross” on the television show Suits, but not quite. I master things better with a hands on approach, rather than just reading and remembering.

                <br><br> As a young girl I always had an obsession with type. I never understood my obsession until I started designing. While designing is my biggest passion, I also have a passion for music, and food.</p>
